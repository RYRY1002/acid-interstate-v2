# How To Install Shader And World

## Shader

To install the Shader, all you need to do is download the file named "[Acid-Interstate-V4_Shader.zip](https://github.com/RYRY1002/acid-interstate-v4/releases/download/download/Acid-Interstate-V4_Shader.zip)"

Then locate your .minecraft shader folder.

### How to locate your .minecraft shader folder

Open Minecraft (with the shaders mod open) and go to Options > Video Settings > Shaders and press "Shaders Folder".

Then copy and paste the downloaded file into this folder, and select it in-game.

### A few things to know about the shader

* Do not teleport more than 100 blocks in either the X or Z axis. It will offset the effects, if you need to go back to the start (which will re-sync the shader) do ```/tp @s 90 128 0 -90 0```.

* Yes, the shader doesn't perform well at all, if it's not performing well, please don't report it as an issue.

## World

To install the World, all you need to do is download the file named "[Acid-Interstate-V4_World.zip](https://github.com/RYRY1002/acid-interstate-v4/releases/download/download/Acid-Interstate-V4_World.zip)"

Then locate your .minecraft save folder.

### How to locate your .minecraft save folder

Open Minecraft (with the shaders mod open) and go to Options > Video Settings > Shaders and press "Shaders Folder".

Then go back to the .minecraft folder (the previous folder), then open the "saves" folder.

Then copy and paste the downloaded file into this folder, and then play the world in-game.

### A few things to know about the world

* If you accidentally mess something up with the world, just re-download it. It's most likely the easiest way to fix it.

* Somethings _(mainly transitions)_ may not make sense when looking at it without the shader, so don't worry, it's not broken, it will be fine with the shader.
