You can publish videos of our work, but if you video revolves around our work, you must put a reference to it in the description of your video _(there is one at the bottom of this document)_. If you video doesn't revolve around it, you don't have to, but we would like it if you did :).

If you publish a video containing a modified version of our shader, go for it. Just give a reference to the original _(as described in 3b)_ and note in the reference that it is modified, but you must not give a download to the modified shader, as it is for your personal use.

Hey, site owners, I better not see this shader and/or video hosted on a site like http://www.9minecraft.net/.
