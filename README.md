# Acid Interstate V2 Repository

Hey, this is the repo for my video, Acid Interstate V2. When the video is done, I'll make a release containing the world and shader used in the video.

Now I have to give some thanks to people for helping me make this video possible

* **MiningGodBruce (BruceKnowsHow)**: For creating the shader that this shader is based on, and helping me fix a few bugs and inspire me to continue developing this video.

By the way, this shader is super broken and should not be used for normal play, because it is made specifically for this video and sometimes doesn't work on some computers for no reason. It also doesn't have good performance and it buggy due to Optifine's CamPos issue.
